## About the project

This project contains scripts for post-processing climate data directly from model outputs. It is organized into several sub-projects, each designed to address a specific research question. Currently, these sub-project are the following:

* ```droughts```: study of the impact of climate change on extreme droughts in central Chile.
* ```fires```: analysis of the extreme wildfires that took place in south-central Chile during 2017 and 2023.
* ```floods```: research on the role of climate change in the occurrence of floods in central Chile.
* ```patagonia```: study of the atmosphere-cryosphere interaction in Western Patagonia.
* ```blocking```: characterization of blocking patterns in the Southern Hemisphere.

Within each sub-project there are scripts for transforming climate data from their raw version (i.e., as they were after downloading) to an easier-to-use version. The specific format of each fine-tuned file dependens on the requirementes of each sub-project.
